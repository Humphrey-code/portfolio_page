    <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>I am an <em>upcoming application developer</em> with a strong background and interest in financial analysis, providing the world with <em>seemless applications</em> that offer real time reports, on your dashboard for decision making.</p>
      <p>Having worked for Financial Advisory firm, PwC Kenya, over the last five years, I have seen the accounting and financial analysis function dynamically change from its traditional role of historical financial information reporting to one that provides strategic insights and influences managerial decisions.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, the SME world, has not been able to adopt this change, owing to the high costs involved in deploying technologies which have majorly been 'imported'and off-the-shelf products.</p>
      <p>For this reason, I ventured into code which has opened up a whole new world of agility and responsivity to events as their happen.</p>
      <p><strong>My take: Leave code to do the donkey work, and rise up to decision making based on real-big-data.<p></strong>
