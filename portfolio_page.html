    <h2>Data 2 Decisions via <code></h2>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>I am an upcoming application developer with a strong background and interest in financial analysis, providing the world with seemless applications that offer real time reports, on your dashboard for decision making</p>
      <p>Having worked for Financial Advisory firm PwC Kenya, over the last five years, I have seen the accounting and financial analysis function dynamically change from its traditional role of historical financial information reporting to one that provides strategic insights and influences managerial decisions</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, the SME world, has not been able to adopt this change, owing to the high costs involved in deploying such technologies which have been mainly 'imported' and off-the-shelf products</p>
      <p>For this reason, I ventured into <code> which has opened u a whole new world of agility and responsivity to events as their happen.</p>
      <p>Mt take; leave <code> to do the manual work and rise up to decision making based on real-big-data</p>
